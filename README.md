# My M2 Macbook Air Setup

![My Wallpaper](https://github.com/msrsaditya/soybook-air/blob/main/wallpaper.png)
# Note

This repo is mostly ported from my Archlinux Setup (https://github.com/msrsaditya/soybook-air) with some tweaks. If Asahi Linux (https://asahilinux.org) becomes stable enough with everything working perfectly, this project will be archived.<br><br>That day when it does, I can flex both around normies and neckbeards at the same time
```archlinux
I use Arch on my M2 Macbook BTW!
```

# Philosophy

1. Don't sign up for Apple ID and don't use Apple products (don't even touch them).
2. Use Terminal for everything (replace the default terminal ofc).
3. No wallpaper, no transparency, No gimmicky additions.
4. Bind keyboard shortcuts (Vim like) for everything just like in a tiling window manager.
5. No crazy configs, just minimal, vanilla and upstream config as much as possible.
6. Don't fall for the matrix, neo (Apple ecosystem).

 # Okay, Why Mac?

 I hate my life for using this bro, but
 1. M1 and M2 chips are the most powerful consumer chips on the market right now with excellent power efficiency and CPU/GPU performance.
 2. The build quality is amazing on these machines -- slim design, excellent sound, display and webcam quality.
 3. Most GUI apps are built for Windows and Mac, leaving out Linux :(
 4. The only real OS you can use other than Windows and Linux is Mac. Windows is bloated, slow and has terrible UI/UX, Linux is missing some GUI apps and has limited hardware support (will be fixed hopefully) 
 5. UNIX Like/BSD based, so most Linux commands, scripts and setups can be easily ported and used.
 6. You can flex around normies that you have money and you're a dEvElOpEr.

# Installation/Setup
This setup is tailormade for my use. If you want to automatically install everything here without going through the hassle of installing every dependency by hand. <br><br>
Clone this repo (Assuming you already have Git installed in your computer)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/msrsaditya/soybook-air
```
Then give executable permissions to dotfiles.sh script
```bash
sudo chmod +x ~/path/to/soybook-air/dotfiles.sh
```
Finally run the script
```bash
./dotfiles.sh
```
It will automatically install all dependencies, copies all config files, Fixes many mac default settings and so on.
