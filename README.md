# Note

This repo is mostly ported from my Archlinux Setup (https://github.com/msrsaditya/iUseArchBTW) with some tweaks. If Asahi Linux (https://asahilinux.org) becomes stable enough with everything working perfectly, this repo will be archived.<br><br>That day when it does, I can flex both around normies and neckbeards at the same time that
```archlinux
I use Arch on my M2 Macbook BTW!
```
# Apps I Use/Recommend

1. Browser -- Brave
2. Code Editor -- Neovim
3. File Manager -- LF 
4. Terminal Emulator -- Alacritty
5. Video Player -- IINA
6. Window Manager -- Rectangle
<br>
&ensp; Along With Some default stuff like ZSH Shell, Finder, Whatsapp, Apple Mail client etc.

 # Okay, Why Mac?

 Mac is a Proprietary Fully-Closed Walled-Garden, but
 1. M1 and M2 chips are the most powerful consumer chips on the market right now with excellent power efficiency and CPU/GPU performance.
 2. The build quality is amazing on these machines -- slim design, excellent sound, display and webcam quality.
 3. Most Apps are built for Windows and Mac, leaving out Linux :(
 4. The only real OS you can use other than Windows and Linux is Mac. Windows is bloated, slow and has terrible UI/UX, With the worst developer experience, Linux is missing some apps, lack of standardisation and very niche and has limited hardware support (will be fixed hopefully) 
 5. UNIX Like/BSD based, so most Linux commands, scripts and setups can be easily ported and used.
 6. You can flex around normies that you have money and you're a dEvElOpEr.

# Installation/Setup
This setup is tailormade for my use. If you want to automatically install everything here without going through the hassle of installing every dependency by hand. <br><br>
Clone this repo (Assuming you already have Git installed in your computer)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/msrsaditya/soybook-air
```
Then give executable permissions to dotfiles.sh script
```bash
sudo chmod +x ~/path/to/soybook-air/dotfiles.sh
```
Finally run the script
```bash
./dotfiles.sh
```
It will automatically install all dependencies, copies all config files, Fixes many mac default settings and so on.
